            <p class="text-center">AkiraChix is a center for excellence and believes that access to education and training is of paramount importance for young women to support them in moving out of the vicious cycle of low-skills, low-productivity, and low-wage employment and as a pathway to bridging the gender gap in the Information Technology industry.
            codeHive is a year-long fully-funded residential program by AkiraChix that provides education and economic opportunity to young women between the age of 19-23 from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. These young women are those that have completed high school but due to financial constraints are unable to further their education. codeHive is a project-based learning program that aims to develop capacity in Graphic Design, Mobile App Development (Java, Android), HTML/CSS and JavaScript (React Js), Python/Django , Product Design (Fusion), Electronics (Arduino), Entrepreneurship, Navigating your journey (Building and growing yourself and others as a woman in Tech), and Professional Development (Getting ready to concur the workforce).

      <p class="mb-5">One goal of AkiraChix is to help you develop as a unique individual—to be educated as a whole person, intellectually, emotionally, socially and ethically. Your development and learning as an individual occur, in part, when you engage in relationships with others and in activities that optimally challenge you. To enhance your growth and learning, become actively involved in the life of the AkiraChix community, engage your fellow students, faculty, staff, and AkiraChix various communities of interests and form relationships that both challenge and support your growth.
      Your journey of individual development does not occur in isolation; it takes place within a dynamic learning community. As a diverse institution, AkiraChix attempts to balance its needs—to foster freedom for individual growth, to support its various communities of interests, and to fulfill its broader teaching and skills development mission.
