        <p>One goal of AkiraChix is to help you develop as a unique individual—to be educated as a whole person, intellectually, emotionally, socially and ethically. Your development and learning as an individual occur, in part, when you engage in relationships with others and in activities that optimally challenge you. To enhance your growth and learning, become actively involved in the life of the AkiraChix community, engage your fellow students, faculty, staff, and AkiraChix various communities of interests and form relationships that both challenge and support your growth.

        Your journey of individual development does not occur in isolation; it takes place within a dynamic learning community. As a diverse institution AkiraChix attempts to balance its needs—to foster freedom for individual growth, to support its various communities of interests, and to fulfill its broader teaching and skills development mission.</p>
