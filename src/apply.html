          <p>codeHive is the AkiraChix signature program. It is a one-year fully subsidized residential hands-on technical training program. It provides education and economic opportunity to young women between 18 and 24 years from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds who have completed high school education, unable to further their education due to financial constraints.</p>
          <p>In 2021 we intend to recruit 70 highly motivated young women from across Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda&rsquo;s underserved communities. And offer market-ready technology training, entrepreneurship, life-skills and leadership training. Our students in the codeHive program also receive mentorship from East Africa&rsquo;s leading names in technology and business and go on one-month work experience. They also get to attend and network at East Africa&rsquo;s leading technology conferences and workshops.</p>
          <p>As part of the program, we also push our students to not only learn but innovate. As part of graduation, students are all required to produce market-ready prototype solutions. And also support our students to find a work placement and for those entrepreneurial in heart, we also offer them 6-month incubation space on campus to set up their enterprise.</p>
          <p>If this describes you, apply today and share it with your friends. Deadline for applications: 15th November 2020 at 11.59 PM (GMT +3)</p>
